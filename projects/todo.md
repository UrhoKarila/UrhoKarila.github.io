We'll see how many of these actually pan out...

- Get a script running on the pi to inform me about weather conditions, and on certain triggers, suggest activities.  
    That is to say, get a machine to kick me when I should go out flying

- Continue updating the Quadcopter documentation
- Continue updating the site's CSS
- Maybe business cards at some point?
- I've started taking the Yang 40. Maybe a series on that?  
    Ideally, these should be in a series. Thankfully CHR put out [a neat doc](https://engineering.chrobinson.com/how-to/linking-a-series-of-jekyll-posts/) on how to get series running in Jekyll, so we'll use that as a base.
