  <h2>Hey there, I'm Grant Ebeling</h2>
  <p>It's hard to sum up who I am in plain HTML, but let's give it a shot.</p>
  
  <p>I'm a <a href="/electronics">software engineer and tinkerer.</a></p>
  <p>I'm a <a href="/projects">maker/hobbyist.</a></p>
  <p>I'm a <a href="/tai-chi">Tai Chi instructor</a>, with the redoubtable Crane Tiger Tai Chi.</p>
  <p>I'm a <a href="/radio-control">radio control hobbyist.</a> Both multicopters and the beginnings of fixed-wings.</p>
  <p>Take a look through there, and maybe something'll jump out at you.</p>
  
  
  <p>If you'd like to get in contact with me, shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:urhoebeling@gmail.com">urhoebeling@gmail.com</a>
  or try to find KE0NPX on the airwaves.</p>
