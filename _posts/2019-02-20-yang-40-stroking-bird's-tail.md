## Way weider than 24

Stroking Bird's Tail is always a lot of fun. I think it might be one of my favorite moves in Yang style, and it's uniquely distinctive across styles. That being said, it's a lot easier to learn the 24's version of it that the 40's. 

It's not that it's _harder_, so much that it goes in so many different directions.

As a result, I think it's imporant to understand something of the context surrounding this movement. We are, of course, beginning from the end of Commencement - facing north, and evenly spread across our hip-width stance. The move is going to be turning us East, stepping North in bow stance, and turning/stepping East once more before settling into a more familiar Bird's Tail sort of rhythm.

As a result, the steps are a little unpredictable.

**1: Ward-off to the East**

The "opening" for this movement is a shift out of the comfortably balanced stance we start in. The weight shifts left, freeing up the right foot to turn Eastward at about a 45ish degree angle. It's not so much a step outwards so much as a readjustment of the foot's position.

- As a side note, here - we're going to be stepping into the rear of our bowstance that we'll be headed North with. It strikes me as an unusual way to construct a bow stance, and I can't recall similar constructions in either the 24 or 42.  

At the same time that the right toe begins to turn out, we'll begin moving our right hand. The position we're aiming for here is a single ward-off to the East. It never quite feels like a straight line to get it there - with the turn of the torso involved, there's something of a curve on the hand's upwards trajectory. Don't feel the need to overconstrain your movements.

The ward-off position is something we'll be coming back to throughout this movement, so it's good to get a handle on it straight off. 
- The hand should be about heart-height - take care not to bring it either too high or too low. The elbow should be heavy, as always, and the shoulder should not rise during this ward-off.
- The hand should also be a comfortable distance from the body. Too close doesn't provide adequate protection, and too far overextends the defense and straightens the joints. I usually settle into a ward-off position that's about as far from my sternum as the length of my forearm.
- Finally, the hand itself should be mostly vertical. We're making a wall here, not serving a platter. The length of the hand, the axis running wrist-to-middle-fingertip, should be horizontal.

Once we have our right foot prepared, and our ward-off in flight, we'll be turning the torso as we shift weight into the right foot. Our hand should find its new home slightly before we shift weight entirely into our right foot.

### The coordination of the feet and hands is tricky, but important.

It's tempting to break the move into a feet-than-hands view, or vice-versa. However, it's key to remember the movement principles of Tai Chi.  In this move, movement is initiated by the Dantian, before flowing outwards to its expression through the movement of the right hand upwards into wardoff and the turn of the right foot.

Ultimately, it's the _weightshift_ that's moving the hands here. Play it a few times, and if your hands are getting ahead of you, dial it back.

**2: Ward-off to the North** 

As we finish our ward-off to the east...
