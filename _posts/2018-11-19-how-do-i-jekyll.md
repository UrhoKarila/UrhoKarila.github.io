## Well, this could be going better.

I think I'm starting to get the sense of how to make posts in Jekyll.

That is, unfortunately, a _far_ cry from how to properly handle Jekyll.

I dunno what's going on with the unfortunate `post.html` template not being properly applied, though it may be a stupid mistake I made while getting this set up.  
Kind of the reason I've run through this -- gotta learn somehow.

Anyways, each category for the blog has its own subfolder, that currently contains only `index.html`. The page itself is dynamically populated on load, pulling form the `_posts` folder.  
This seems like a lot of busy work -- there may be a restructuring coming once I figure out a better way of doing this.
