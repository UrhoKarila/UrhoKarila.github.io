## So somebody posted something neat to work's slack a few days back...

![The post in question](/assets/images/series.png)

_neat_

This ties in nicely with something I've been considering for a while. I've been looking to have a reason to get into the habit of updating this at least _semi_-regularly, and I'm thinking that the Yang 40 form I'm learning might be just the trick.  

Constantly and iteratively posting about something that I'm learning piecemeal? Seems like a place to fit a series!

Naturally, I'm going to have to go through the config for getting a series set up. Once that's set... We'll see if I can keep up with the form as we learn it.
