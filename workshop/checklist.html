<h3>E011 Quadcopter</h3>

<div class="checklist-body">

<div class="image">

</div>

<p class="desc">
The main piece of equipment required for this operation. These are the E011 quads - the ones for the workshop were obtained <a href="https://www.banggood.com/Eachine-E011-Mini-2_4G-Headless-Mode-With-60000RPM-716-Coreless-Motor-Toy-Brick-RC-Quadcopter-RTF-p-1135724.html?rmmds=search" target="_blank">here</a>.  
They are also available on amazon, or from other sellers.

<h3>Double check the header installation</h3>

<div class="checklist-body">
<div class="image">
    <img src="/assets/images/header.jpg" alt="Image of the header">
</div>

<p class="desc">
If you've obtained the quadcopter through the workshop, it should have been modified with a 4-pin header across the UART programming pins. 
The header is polarized, so take careful note of its orientation on the board. If yours is the opposite direction of what is shown here, you'll want to reverse the order of Jumper Wire connections to the ST-Link.

<h3>Transmitter</h3>

<div class="checklist-body">
<div class="image">
    <img src="/assets/images/transmitter.jpg" alt="Transmitter image">
</div>

<p class="desc">
    A small control transmitter included with the quadcopter. Replacing this usually means buying a new quadcopter -- transmitters are not sold seperately.  
    If you have a radio with an XJT module bay, this can be replaced with multiprotocol modules that are compatible with the Bayang protocol.

<h3>Batteries</h3>

    <img src="/assets/images/battery.jpg" alt="Battery Image">
</div>

<p class="desc">
    The stock battery for the E011 is a single cell 260mAh Lithium Polymer battery. If you've lost yours, they are available in small quantites from a variety of sellers. `260mah lipo` is a decent start for googling.

<p class="desc">
    The ST-Link v2 is used to write data from the computer to the quadcopter. These are widely available and can be found, for example, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313.TR12.TRC2.A0.H0.XST-Link.TRS0&_nkw=ST-Link&_sacat=0" target="_blank">here</a>

<h3> Header jumper</h3>

<div class="image">
    <img src="/assets/images/header-jumper.jpg" alt="Header Jumper image">
</div>

<p class="desc">
Also in your kit is a jumper wire. This is harder to replace, so take care not to lose it.  
One end of the jumper is terminated with a fairly no-name 1.25mm pitch 4 pin polarized connector, similar to <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/1-25mm-Polarized-Connector-5-9inch-Skywalking/dp/B00HTIV6G8" target="_blank">this one</a>.  
The other is crimped into a 4-posiiton male connector compatible with the Jumper Wires included above.
