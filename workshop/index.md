# Hey, welcome to the workshop

This page is (hopefully) going to get you walked through the experience of reflashing drone firmware for the E011. Feel free to give suggestions on how it can be improved.

## First things first

If you haven't already, pop on over to the [main project repository](https://github.com/urhokarila/eachine-e011). There's a README file there that can serve as backup if this guide's missing something.  
Also, make sure you've cloned it to your local machine. If you're in the workshop with me, this should already be done for you.

## After that
